Here I discuss the contents of the supporting files.

IMPORTANT: Remember to adapt the locations of the file imports in the notebooks to your own device. These are usually of the form: '/Users/username/.../selectedfile.txt'

Provided files:

• EPO_PATENTS_RAW.txt --> Raw EPO data of all patents according to the inventors.
• EPO_IPC_RAW.txt --> Raw EPO data of all IPC codes associated to their application ID (There are multiple IPC codes for each ID).
• EPO_CITATIONS_RAW.txt --> Raw EPO data of all citations between patents.
